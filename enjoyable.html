    <h3> My Mother The Cheerleader <br>(Assignment: 403-415):</h3>  
    <p> Perhaps one of my favorite books of all time was My Mother the Cheerleader, which was a roller coaster of a novel. My Mother the Cheerleader had surprises and plot twists throughout the entire novel, and this paired alongside the several intense, controversial, and heated arguments in our book club meetings fueled a few weeks of enjoyment. Even during the preparation days, the book was super entertaining, and for a book in a genre that I typically do not enjoy, plus the fact that I was forced to read this book, its surprising to me that the book was that good, and the assignments were just as enjoyable. </p>
